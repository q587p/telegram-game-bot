# Telegram Game Bot (0.0.23)

- Console banner: “Server started — Telegram bot vX.Y.Z (long polling)”.
- Walls UX: on boundary bump, map shifts visually and shows a virtual wall outside the grid.
- Everything else as in 0.0.19 (EN/UK i18n, inline buttons, seeded quests, energy regen, skills, persisted sessions).
